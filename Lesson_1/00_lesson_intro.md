# What are we doing?
![Confusion](../IMGS/Whats_happening.gif)

So, this first lesson we're just going over:
* How to pick a Python version
* What to look out for when porting code between Python versions
* How to install a specific Python version
* How to set up your IDE
* How to manage your dependencies with PIP
* A very brief introduction to some of the most basic Python code (would be too boring if we didn't do this!)
* A short challenge to give you something to do in your newly set up development environment
