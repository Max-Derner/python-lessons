# Installing Python on WSL
Ok, you're using a Mac. I think homebrew gives a nice experience with installing stuff but I know other people who use Pyenv. I'm going to give one instruction set only.  

## Homebrew
Go [here](https://brew.sh/) and follow the instructions **_carefully!_**  
Now, when you install Homebrew it will give you additional instructions on how to finish setup right there in the command line. It is imperative that you read all the output or you risk not setting up homebrew right.  
Once you got homebrew installed, you can just give commands like:
```
brew install python@3.12
```

## Apologies
I'm super sorry, I've never used a Mac. I know the above works but it does give you an extra package manager to manage.
