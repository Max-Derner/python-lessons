This is by no means all I would recommend you learning about but as a first toe dip into the ocean of what's out there. These are pretty essential (except for the turtle, who's just fun)
# [pprint](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pprint.html)
`pprint` is an extremely simple library that allows pretty-printing of data structures.  

# [json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html)
`json` is another extremely simple library that allows simple and easy parsing of JSON data

# [math](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html) (they did mean math***s***)
`math` is a library which is spelt wrong. It offers some of the mathematical operations that allows Python to pass it's GCSEs and A-levels, instead of simply graduating from primary school.

# [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html)
`random` gives you all that randomising goodness (it's **not suitable** for cryptographic functions as it's easily predictable) but for randomly selecting a user greeting or something like that, it's bloody perfect.

# [time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html)
`time` is a little more complex but it gives you the `sleep` command which you might like to use here and there.

# [turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html)
`turtle` is definitely not something that you will use professionally but it lets you draw by walking a turtle (who is in disguise, so definitely doesn't look like a turtle) around on a page. So it's fun to use when you're playing around and learning loops. Why not try drawing a circle with turtle?
