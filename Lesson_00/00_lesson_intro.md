# What are we doing?

You're a professional, you need to understand things on a deep level. Before we can learn things in a very thorough manner, we first need a broad understanding that can provide a framework to fit knowledge into.  

The first lesson is everything in one way. The rest are one thing in everyway.  

So we'll go over the bare minimum for:
* environment set-up
* variables
* functions
* classes
* loops
* running code

This will provide us a very rough understanding which we can build on in future lessons.
