# What are we doing?

You're a professional, you need to understand things on a deep level. Before we can learn things in a very thorough manner, we first need a broad understanding that can provide a framework to fit knowledge into.  

This zeroth lesson is everything in one way. The rest are one thing in everyway.  

So we'll go over the bare minimum for:
* installing Python/Python installation verification
* IDE set-up
* virtual environments
* installing libraries
* running code
* variables
* logical expressions
* comments
* input/output
* maths n stuff
* logic flow
* loops
* functions
* but **not** classes 
    * I don't want you to start your Python journey spending all your time making classes, just use Python intuitively and come to appreciate the ability to do hacky rapid prototyping

Then we're going to do a somewhat daunting challenge just to prove how clever you are.  

This will provide us a very rough understanding that serves as a framework to slot extra in depth context into on our journey to professional competence.
