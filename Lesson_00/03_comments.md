You might be used to single line comments **_and_** multi-line comments.  
Well, we just have the one:
```
# This is a Python comment
# notice how there is a '#' symbol followed by a space and then the comment content
# Also notice how I was fine to use the '#' symbol in a comment
```
If you want to have a comment after some code:
```
my_int = 1  # well in that case, I need to have two spaces before the '#' symbol and one after
```
