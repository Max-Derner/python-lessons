# things to consider
publish to PyPI
publish to personal PyPI server+mirror
publish to private PyPI server+mirror with access control
making sure you name your package in PyPI even if it's hosted privately because of supply chain attack

`TestPyPI` exists for uploading test packages to make sure everything works as expected [https://test.pypi.org/](https://test.pypi.org/)
