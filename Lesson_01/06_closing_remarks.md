# What the heck did we even learn?

Well, we kinda went off that rails a little bit there but we ended up covering:
* basic classes
* privates
* constants
* default arguments (and how to do them right)
* docstrings
* inheritance
* method resolution order
* class variables Vs instance variables
* multiple inheritance
* `super()`
* how to do `super()` for more than one parent
* name mangling
* getters and setters
* dunder methods

See you next time!
