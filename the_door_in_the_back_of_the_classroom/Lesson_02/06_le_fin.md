That's it for today, bet you're a bit worn now but you should know pretty much everything you'd want to know about exception handling.

This lesson we've learned about:
* the different types of built in exceptions
* the different methods available for handling exceptions including the `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks.
* the `traceback` module
* custom exceptions
* class based and function based context managers

Righty, go have some fun, take a break.
